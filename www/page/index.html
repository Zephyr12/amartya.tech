    <h1>Hi!</h1>
<p>I am Amartya Vadlamani, a second-year computer science student at UCL. I mostly
program recreationally but I am starting to branch out and do more professional
contracting work. My main interests include machine learning, graphics
programming and programming language theory. I mostly program in Python, C and
Rust depending on the occasion and am familiar with the latest HTML5 and CSS3
trends and features.</p>
<h2>Where are you?</h2>
<p>You are at my personal website, where I host my projects and occasionally
upload post-mortems about them. As you can see it is currently empty. This is
because I just finished transitioning the site over to using a custom static
site generator that I wrote in Python using YAML, Jinja2 and Markdown.</p>
<h2>Achievements</h2>
<p>I do a lot of things in my spare time. I'm even proud of some of them.</p>
<p>When I was 14, I participated in 
<a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&amp;uid=27354">Ludem Dare 27</a>, 
a two day game jam. I started and finished a whole game working just by myself
back when the only language I knew was C# and could only use it with Unity. I
still remember trying to stay up all night to get the AI behavior bug free and
functional in-time for me to do the art and level design the next day.</p>
<p>I built an <a href="https://github.com/Zephyr12/Comp-4">invoice tracker</a> for small
scale companies to use in their internal systems. The code isn't amazing and my
git hygiene was appalling, but it was the first project that I created that
actually got anywhere. Anywhere, in this case, being a spot as an internal system
at a small consulting company.</p>
<p>Last year I built a <a href="https://github.com/Zephyr12/COMP103_AppProject">VR-Video Tagger</a>.
The system allowed you to upload a 360VR Video and presented you with an
interface that enabled the user to tag interesting elements in the video with
interactive tags that included full web content. This was then exported out to
a custom viewer that would then play the video and allow the user to interact
with the tags projected in 3d space. I got to the point where I could browse
Wikipedia in full VR using the application. I wrote the tagging engine in
Django and a small Java Plugin that integrated the WebView with the 3D
environment by rendering the WebView into it's own texture which could then be
sent to the GL context that was doing the 3D rendering.</p>
<p>Finally, this site generator. Mostly because the actual code is so small and
achieves so much in such a small space.</p>
